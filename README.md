# Movie Recommendation System Data Preparation
## Module 6 data-sourcing-challenge
This repository contains code for preparing data for a recommendation system aimed at helping people find movie reviews and related movies. The data is extracted from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database. The extracted text from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.

## Challenge Overview
This challenge consists of three parts, which must be completed in order:

# Part 1: Access the New York Times API
# Part 2: Access The Movie Database API
# Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export

The starter code includes the necessary dependencies and API keys from a .env file. However, ensure that your API keys are correctly added to the .env file. The base URL is provided in the starter code, along with the search string and query dates. Refer to the New York Times Article Search API documentation to build the query URL using these variables.

## Part 1: Access the New York Times API
This part involves accessing the New York Times API to retrieve movie reviews and related information. The search query and query dates are provided, and you need to construct the query URL accordingly.

## Part 2: Access The Movie Database API
In this part, you will access The Movie Database API to fetch additional details about the movies. You will make requests to extract all the necessary details, including movie IDs, using search queries based on movie titles.

## Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export
The final part involves merging the data obtained from both APIs and performing any necessary cleaning operations. Once the data is merged and cleaned, it will be prepared for export.

Refer to the Search & Query for Details documentation to build your query URLs for accessing The Movie Database API.

If you accidentally delete any essential variables, you can refer to the provided starter code for reference.

For further details and instructions, please consult the respective API documentation and the provided starter code.
